## 📘 Basic Tasks

These tasks are designed to build foundational understanding of ML concepts and tools.

### ✅ Task 1: Implement a Simple Linear Regression  
- Load a dataset (e.g., house prices or student scores)  
- Apply simple linear regression  
- Visualize the regression line  
- Evaluate with metrics like MSE or R²  

### ✅ Task 2: Classify Data with a Decision Tree  
- Use a labeled dataset (e.g., Iris or Titanic)  
- Train a decision tree classifier  
- Visualize the decision tree  
- Interpret decision boundaries  

### ✅ Task 3: Visualize Data with a Scatter Plot  
- Choose two variables from a dataset  
- Plot them using matplotlib or seaborn  
- Add colors or labels for categories if applicable  
- Use the visualization to observe correlations or clusters

## 📗 Intermediate Tasks

These tasks help in understanding the intricacies of data processing and model evaluation.

### 🚀 Task 1: Build a Model with Cross-Validation  
- Implement k-fold cross-validation  
- Evaluate model consistency across folds  
- Use sklearn's `cross_val_score`  

### 🚀 Task 2: Preprocess Data for Machine Learning  
- Handle missing values  
- Normalize or scale features  
- Encode categorical variables  
- Split into training and testing sets  

### 🚀 Task 3: Create a Classification Report  
- Train a classification model  
- Predict test labels  
- Generate a report with precision, recall, f1-score using `classification_report`

## 📙 Expert Tasks

These tasks push deeper into complex modeling, optimization, and deployment.

### 🌟 Task 1: Develop a Neural Network for Classification  
- Use frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch  
- Build a feedforward neural network  
- Train and validate on a dataset (e.g., MNIST or CIFAR-10)  
- Track accuracy and loss  

### 🌟 Task 2: Implement Hyperparameter Tuning  
- Use Grid Search or Random Search  
- Optimize parameters like learning rate, depth, or batch size  
- Compare and select the best performing model  

### 🌟 Task 3: Deploy a Machine Learning Model  
- Save the trained model (e.g., using joblib or pickle)  
- Create a Flask or FastAPI backend  
- Build a simple UI or API endpoint for inference  
- Test deployment locally or on a cloud platform
